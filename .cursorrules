# Cursor AI Rules for HighRise AI Project

## Vercel Deployment Compatibility (CRITICAL)

This project deploys to Vercel via the `staging` branch. **ALL code changes MUST pass `npm run build` before completion.**

### Mandatory Workflow (STRICT):
1. **AUTOMATIC CACHE CLEANING**: Cache is now automatically cleaned before `npm run dev` and `npm run build` via npm pre-hooks. No manual cache cleaning needed!
2. **After making ANY code changes**: Just run `npm run dev` or `npm run build` - cache cleaning happens automatically
3. **Before marking task complete**: Ensure build passes with exit code 0
4. **Event handlers**: Always extract values from events (`e.target.checked`, `e.target.value`)
5. **Type definitions**: Must match actual component usage - update types when adding properties
6. **Multiple threads**: If generating code in multiple threads, the ensure-clean script will handle process cleanup automatically
7. **Manual override**: If you need to manually clean cache, run `bash scripts/ensure-clean.sh`

### Common Errors to Prevent:
- ❌ Missing properties in type definitions
- ❌ Passing event objects instead of extracted values
- ❌ Type mismatches in onChange handlers
- ❌ Stale `.next` cache causing "Cannot find module" errors
- ❌ Not cleaning cache after file deletions or major refactoring

### Build Verification (MANDATORY):
```bash
# Cache cleaning is AUTOMATIC via npm pre-hooks - just run:
npm run build

# Or for dev server:
npm run dev

# The prebuild/predev hooks automatically clean cache and kill stale processes
# No manual cache cleaning needed anymore!
```

### Cache Management (AUTOMATIC):
- ✅ Cache cleaning is now AUTOMATIC - npm hooks handle it
- ✅ No need to manually clean cache before builds or dev server
- ✅ Multiple threads are handled automatically - stale processes are killed
- ✅ If you see "Cannot find module" errors, just restart: `npm run dev` or `npm run build`

See `.vercel-deployment-guide.md` for detailed guidelines.

## Example Documentation Guidelines (CRITICAL)

**NEVER add `highLevelApplication` property to example cards unless the user explicitly requests it.**

### Example Structure:
- ✅ Include: `title`, `description`, `media`, `tags`, `critique`
- ❌ Do NOT include: `highLevelApplication` (unless user specifically asks for it)

### Components with `highLevelApplication` removed:
- Input Slider
- Accordion  
- Progress Indicator
- ToDos Accordion

**Rule**: When adding examples to any component, only include `highLevelApplication` if the user explicitly mentions it in their request.

## Localhost Dev Server Reliability (CRITICAL)

**NEVER leave localhost broken or non-functional.** Always ensure the dev server runs successfully after code changes.

### MANDATORY: Always Start Dev Server After Code Changes
**CRITICAL RULE**: After making ANY code changes (small or large), you MUST:
1. **ALWAYS start the dev server** by running `npm run dev` in the background
2. **NEVER kill the dev server** unless the user explicitly tells you to do so
3. **Verify the server is running** and accessible before marking tasks complete

**This applies to:**
- ✅ Component creation or modification
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Configuration changes
- ✅ Any file changes that affect the application
- ✅ Small changes AND large changes

**Exception**: Only kill/restart the dev server if:
- User explicitly asks you to kill/restart it
- There's a port conflict that prevents starting (then kill old process first)
- Build fails and requires cache clearing (then restart after clearing)

### Mandatory Dev Server Workflow:
1. **After making code changes**: ALWAYS run `npm run dev` in the background
2. **If port 3000 is already in use**: The npm pre-hook will handle cleanup automatically
3. **After code generation**: Verify dev server is running and accessible
   ```bash
   sleep 8 && curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000
   # Should return 200
   ```
4. **Client Components**: ALWAYS add `'use client'` directive at the top of files that use:
   - React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, etc.)
   - Event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`, etc.)
   - Browser APIs (`window`, `document`, `localStorage`, etc.)
   - Any interactive features

### Common Localhost Issues to Prevent:
- ❌ Multiple dev servers running simultaneously (port conflicts)
- ❌ Missing `'use client'` directive in components using hooks/events
- ❌ Stale `.next` cache causing runtime errors
- ❌ Server-side components importing client-only code
- ❌ Not verifying server starts successfully after changes

### Dev Server Checklist:
- ✅ **ALWAYS start dev server after code changes** (MANDATORY)
- ✅ **NEVER kill dev server** unless user explicitly requests it
- ✅ Clear `.next` cache if experiencing strange errors
- ✅ Verify `'use client'` is present in all interactive components
- ✅ Test that localhost loads successfully after code changes
- ✅ Never leave localhost in a broken or non-running state
- ✅ Verify server responds with HTTP 200 before marking tasks complete

### Quick Fixes:
```bash
# Kill all Next.js processes
pkill -f "next dev" || true
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# Clear cache and restart (ALWAYS do this if you see module resolution errors)
rm -rf .next && npm run dev

# For production build issues, clean cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next && npm run build

# Verify server is running
curl -s http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null && echo "✓ Server OK" || echo "✗ Server failed"
```

### Build Cache Management (CRITICAL):
**ALWAYS clean `.next` cache when:**
- You see "Cannot find module" errors
- You've deleted or renamed files
- You've restructured component examples
- Build fails with module resolution issues
- Dev server shows stale errors

**SIMPLIFIED workflow after ANY file changes (cache cleaning is AUTOMATIC):**
```bash
# STEP 1: Just run dev or build - cache cleaning happens automatically!
npm run dev
# OR
npm run build

# STEP 2: Verify server is running (if using dev)
sleep 8 && curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000
# Should return 200

# That's it! The npm pre-hooks handle all cache cleaning and process cleanup automatically.
```

**CRITICAL RULES**: 
- ✅ Cache cleaning is AUTOMATIC - no manual steps needed
- ✅ Just use `npm run dev` or `npm run build` - hooks handle everything
- ✅ Multiple threads are safe - ensure-clean script handles conflicts
- ✅ Always verify the server responds with HTTP 200 before marking task complete
